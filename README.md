**Univariate Analysis**

---

The gender distribution in the company is nearly balanced, with 253 female employees and 247 male employees. This indicates a well-maintained gender ratio in the workforce, which can contribute to a diverse and inclusive work environment.  

Looking at the distribution of employees by department, Marketing has the highest number of employees (112), followed closely by Sales (109). HR, Finance, and Engineering have slightly fewer employees, with Engineering having the least at 91. This suggests that the company places a strong focus on marketing and sales, possibly due to business needs or company strategy.  

When it comes to performance ratings, the most common rating is 5, received by 111 employees, while 101 employees received the lowest rating of 1. The distribution across other ratings (2, 3, and 4) is relatively even. This indicates that while some employees perform exceptionally well, there are also a significant number of employees who may need improvement or support.

**Bivariate Analysis**
---
The average salary varies across departments, with Sales employees earning the highest average salary of approximately $68,376, followed by Finance at $65,419. HR and Marketing have similar average salaries, around $64,129 and $65,009, respectively, while Engineering has the lowest average salary at about $61,315. This suggests that Sales roles might offer higher incentives or commissions compared to other departments.  

Employee satisfaction scores also differ slightly by department. Finance employees have the highest average satisfaction score of 5.70, followed by Sales at 5.60, and Marketing at 5.53. Engineering employees report the lowest satisfaction, with an average score of 5.35. While the differences are not drastic, they may indicate variations in work culture, workload, or job expectations across departments.  

Regarding tenure, Finance employees have the longest average years at the company (10.41 years), closely followed by HR (10.40 years). Sales and Marketing employees have slightly shorter tenures, averaging around 10 years, while Engineering employees have the shortest tenure at 9.66 years. This could mean that Finance and HR roles offer more stability, while Engineering might experience higher turnover rates.  

When comparing performance ratings by gender, males have a slightly higher average performance score (3.09) compared to females (2.98). While the difference is minor, it raises questions about potential factors influencing performance assessments, such as job roles, workload distribution, or evaluation criteria.

***Group analysis***
---
 The average age by gender shows that males are slightly older on average (41.26 years) compared to females (40.15 years). While the difference is minimal, it might reflect variations in hiring trends or career progression between genders.  

Across departments, Engineering has the highest average age (41.87 years), followed closely by Marketing (41.63 years) and HR (40.81 years). Finance and Sales have slightly younger employees, with averages of 39.35 and 39.81 years, respectively. This suggests that technical roles in Engineering might require more experience, leading to an older workforce.  

When analyzing salary based on years at the company, there is no clear upward trend. Employees with 17 years of experience earn the highest average salary ($71,810), while those with 9 years earn the lowest ($58,221). Salaries fluctuate at different tenure levels, possibly due to promotions, role changes, or variations in company pay structures over time.  

Finally, when looking at tenure by gender, males have a longer average stay at the company (10.51 years) compared to females (9.68 years). This may suggest differences in career longevity, turnover rates, or workplace retention factors between genders.
